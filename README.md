# weather-app

A weather application that displays the current weather forecast based on your location.

### Known Issues

Because the web app uses the Geolocation API it doesn't support browsers like Safari even if the MDN docs say something different.
There are known issues, that Geolocation only works on Safari, if the device is connected to a WIFI signal.
